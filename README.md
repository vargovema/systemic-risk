# Deep Learning Perspective on Systemic Risk with Non-Normal Risk Factors

## Overview

This thesis addresses the limitations of traditional systemic risk models, which often assume normally distributed risk factors, by leveraging advanced deep learning techniques. By integrating methods like the Student-t distribution and copulas, this research aims to provide a more accurate and comprehensive framework for assessing systemic risk, ultimately enhancing the resilience of financial systems.

## Introduction

This thesis introduces a novel approach to systemic risk assessment by integrating deep learning methodologies with systemic risk measures that consider non-normal risk factors. By employing distributions such as the Student-t distribution and copulas, which are known for capturing fat tails and extreme dependencies, this research aims to provide a more realistic and comprehensive framework for systemic risk evaluation.

The primary objectives of this thesis are threefold:
1. To review and critique existing systemic risk measures and their limitations in the context of non-normal risk factors.
2. To develop and implement deep learning algorithms capable of handling complex, high-dimensional financial data to improve the accuracy of systemic risk predictions.
3. To compare the performance of these deep learning models against traditional methods using simulated data representing various risk factor distributions.

By addressing these objectives, this thesis contributes to the field of quantitative finance by enhancing our understanding of systemic risk and providing practical tools for risk management. The findings are expected to have implications for financial institutions, regulators, and policymakers, aiding in the development of more resilient financial systems.

In the subsequent chapters, the focus is on the motivation behind this research, review of relevant literature, methodological framework, results of the deep learning models, and discussion of implications and potential future directions for systemic risk management.
